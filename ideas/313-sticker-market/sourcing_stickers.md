## Illustrator Brief

### About Status

Status is building a secure messaging platform that allows you to transact and interact with the decentralized web. Our goal is to enable people to organize, exchange value and communicate without any reliance on centralized third parties or intermediaries.

We offer a tool that is and always will be free to use, and which does not collect data on its users but instead actively seeks to protect them from metadata leakage.

The project launched in 2017 with a successful ICO and has since attracted a large community of individuals who care deeply about the importance of privacy, censorship resistance and open source software.

The following are Status' principles:

**I. Liberty**
We believe in the sovereignty of individuals. As a platform that stands for the cause of personal liberty, we aim to maximize social, political, and economic freedoms. This includes being coercion-resistant.

**II. Censorship resistance**
We enable free flow of information. No content is under surveillance. We abide by the cryptoeconomic design principle of censorship resistance. Even stronger, Status is an agnostic platform for information.

**III. Security**
We don't compromise on security when building features. We use state-of-the-art technologies, and research new security methods and technologies to make strong security guarantees.

**IV. Privacy**
Privacy is the power to selectively reveal oneself to the world. For us, it's essential to protect privacy in both communications and transactions, as well as being a pseudo-anonymous platform. Additionally, we strive to provide the right of total anonymity.

**V. Transparency**
We strive for complete openness and symmetry of information within the organization, and have no border between our core contributors and our community. We are frank about our shortcomings, especially when making short-term tradeoffs in service of our long-term goals.

**VI. Openness**
The software we create is a public good. It is made available via a free and open source license, for anyone to share, modify and benefit from. We believe in permission-less participation.

**VII. Decentralization**
We minimize centralization across both the software and the organization itself. In other words, we maximize the number of physical computers composing the network, and maximize the number of individuals who have control over the system(s) we are building.

**VIII. Inclusivity**
We believe in fair and widespread access to our software, with an emphasis on ease-of-use. This also extends to social inclusivity, permissionless participation, interoperability, and investing in educational efforts.

**IX. Continuance**
We create software incentivized to continue to exist and improve, without the stewardship of a single entity or any of the current team members.

**X. Resourcefulness**
We are relentlessly resourceful. As we grow and have ready access to capital, it is our obligation to token holders to fight bureaucracy and inefficiencies within the organization. This means solving problems in the most effective way possible at lower economic costs (in terms of capital, time and resources).

To bring more fun to chatting on Status _and_ build value for SNT, we're introducing a sticker market.

Stickers are one of the most popular elements of the most-used chat platforms today.

Based on our research, we know that people love stickers in the same way they love pop songs. There's not much to explain; they're just fun. They enable greater expression, and they're catchy—you want to share them.

According to our users, the best sticker sets are usually based on a cute character, and demonstrate a range of emotions. They're versatile. 

Many sticker sets contain upwards of 20 stickers.

#### Requirements

We're looking for two key things in the packs we commission:

**1. Fun, expressive, playful character(s).** We'd expect these stickers to be popular in context of any messenger.

**2. They express our principles.** In addition to expressing a range of emotions, we'd love to see the themes of our principles woven in. Can we make concepts like privacy, security and transparency fun?

Regarding style, we have no requirements. 2D vs. 3D, user of color, etc. All up to the illustrator.

We are open to both static and animated images, but to get the widest range of stickers possible within our budget, we're happy to stick with static. 

Sticker images should be in a square ratio.

#### Markets

Status is a global community. We have users around the world, so for these first sticker packs, it's best not to lean on specific cultural references.

The language of the platform is predominately English, though we do offer translations for our users in Southeast Asia and China, Latin America, eastern Europe, etc. Our community is particularly strong in South Korea.

#### Timing

The target launch for our sticker market is by the end of Q1 2019 (end of March).

#### Budget

We have a total budget of $10k USD.

#### Credit

Illustrators' names will be given as the artist credit within Status.
