<h2 id="product-overview">Product Overview</h2>

<p>We want to provide a mechanism for SNT Holders to be able to vote on proposals and features using their token balance.</p>

<p>Each token represents 1 vote, and the balance can be allocated proportionally between the different options a proposal may have, in order to determine the interest level and priorize features.</p>

<h3 id="requirements--dependencies">Requirements &amp; Dependencies</h3>

<p>The final goal for this DApp is to be managed via Liquid Democracy. Idea #172 needs to be implemented before the final iteration of this swarm is completed</p>
