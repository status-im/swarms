> Neutral: WHere are they announced, who validates and create the slack channel?,
> 
> Disagree: Sometimes the lines between in progress & draft seems to be a bit blurred ( some work is done before is officially in progress for example).
> 
> Agree: Oskar's work on that site (and the fact I have had to review a lot of stuff there for bounties) has left me with great insight into the process.
> 
> Neutral: I'm not sure how swarms officially start. Some seem to start without an idea and others seem to stay in draft.
> 
> Neutral: Well, it's like clear, but i'd add some global notification (maybe in core channel) like '@channel - this is official start of the swarm #XXXX, join the respective channel!'
> 
> Neutral: Start of work and formal establishment of the swarm may overlap.
> 
> Agree: I *think* it's when a PR has been requested.,
> 
> Agree: It seems that swarms can start even when they are in draft mode - or is that not the case. I guess hence the relative clarity
> 
> Disagree: If a swarm lead is not super clear about when the swarm actually starts, then it's not clear when one starts.
> 
> Disagree: There is a certain amount of work required to get the swarm started in the first place - defining scope and all that. So, what is the difference between the moment this prep work starts and the moment when actual swarm starts?,

### Comments

> Agree: Scope is done, milestones achieved,
> 
> Agree: Highly depends on swarm,
> 
> Neutral: not enough data to answer this, it is clear on paper (when exit criteria are met) but I would like to see it before in action.
> 
> Strongly Agree: OKRs and clear exit criteria make this much easier and we seem to be developing an org shorthand (P0, P1 etc) that allows us to talk about complex things quickly and simply enough for everyone to get a handle on things. This should be strongly encouraged.
> 
> Agree: It requires checking after a while whether it hasn't been re-activated, but the concept is clear.
> 
> Neutral: Who validates the success metrics?
> 
> Agree: All OKRs and exit criteria have been met.,
> 
> Neutral: Feels a little less clear and seems as though some swarms with remaining iterations get overshadowed by new swarms or ideas. 
> 
> Neutral: Depends on how clear is exit criteria
> 
> Disagree: The whole point of a swarm is to be somewhat eternal and yet somewhat ephemeral. To say when a swarm ends is kind of... non sequiter? Would that be the correct word? In any case, it never really ends when started up imv.

> Disagree: I dont know how is this well-defined right now but it may be my personal view. In terms of scope mostly. Like all swarms (almost) are some kind of feature-based (like fast-status for ex) but scope is not well defined, like it is not only the issues fixing to me but it is achieving some UX cases that we can check with real users (in 90 % cases). So personally i think this could be improved and stated more clearly, like which scenarios (UX cases / user stories / whatever ) we want to achieve in terms of particular swarm (team) and separate them to iterations according to the workload and capacity
> 
> Agree: Must have a specific set of _achievable_ OKRs and exit criteria and resources that can dedicate some time.
