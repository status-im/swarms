<p>Status Core is responsible for implementing a decentralized, reliable Ethereum reference client for Mobile on Android and iOS. This client should provide a reliable communication medium and ability to access the open decentralized web.</p>

<p>Mobile: The highest priority is to prepare Status to the public release in terms of performance and reliability.</p>

<p>Desktop: support and make usable for core contributors; do releases; reuse mobile codebase as much as possible to simplify feature development and bugfixing, with the goal of supporting <code class="highlighter-rouge">react-native-desktop</code> only.</p>

<p>Core needs an accountable, passionate get-shit-done mentality and drive, in contrast to the meandering blame-shifting.</p>
