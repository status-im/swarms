<blockquote>
  <p>What problem are you solving? Who are you solving this for?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Status Wallet facilitates ethereum usage and transactions, but does not offer a compelling reason for users to download and open the app.  Our research (<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eJP-Hh4tN6XZREIy73GNuJP1LqGg41EvP5QpVlFZQ78/edit#slide=id.g3e1b33ca7e_2_36">July ‘18</a>, <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11vEgAbZgXvCwiS2QdMmW3vjOBApx5y8ARXNbFLyJBuk/edit#slide=id.g3beee3ddf4_0_0">June ‘14</a>) has shown there are two main problems that prevent wallet usage:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Usability issues that prevent simple transaction and erode trust
    <ul>
      <li>Usability issues of our wallet specifically (e.g. how much am I sending, what is the value in fiat when sending via wallet and via chat)</li>
      <li>Usability issues of Ethereum itself (e.g. what does it mean 5 confirmations, was it sent or now? what is gas?)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lack of killer features that drive adoption
    <ul>
      <li>Lack of a goal-driven interaction flow. E.g. buy SNT/Cryptokitty</li>
      <li>For non crypto users; a lack of introduction or guidance. “I’ll look into that later because I don’t know what I’m doing.” E.g. what would a gentle transition from a DApp to wallet look like.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Will solving this problem advance the goals of Status and adhere to its principles?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Status aims to be a gateway to ethereum, and wallet and transactions are at the core of this ambition. Many aspects of the Status vision including the whitepaper depend on a functioning wallet that is secure, private, and easy to use, therefore it is important that Wallet creates a core foundation of usability and delight through best-in-class UI and compelling features.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the central Wallet feature - transaction signing - is essential for dapp usage within Status , and vice versa.</p>

<p>Solving usability bottlenecks and introducing killer features that give users a reason to open Status will ensure that Status drives adoption and will unblock more advanced use cases outlined in the whitepaper and beyond.</p>

<h3 id="success-criteria">Success Criteria</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>How will we know when this problem has been addressed? What are qual and quant metrics that will help evaluate?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Success for wallet is having the best mobile user experience for transactions, is super easy to use, offers compelling features, and is the best way to easily get tokens.  A fun onboarding experience is essential to give new users something to do and people to connect with.</p>

<ul>
  <li>80%+ of UXR subjects report a positive experience when transacting</li>
  <li>5+ organic reports of users using Status for transactions (eg tweets, sightings, etc)</li>
  <li>3+ way for users to acquire tokens</li>
</ul>
