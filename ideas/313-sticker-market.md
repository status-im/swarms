Sticker Market 
===

## Summary and Goals

Stickers are a must-have for any messenger, particularly with Asian markets in mind.

The goal of the Status sticker market is two-fold:

1) Allow users to buy and use stickers in chat.
2) Allow creators to sell stickers permissionlessly through a curated marketplace.

For the initial scope, the focus is on use case #1.

We can commission a set of stickers to populate the marketplace starting out.

## Research
