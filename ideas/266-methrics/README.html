<h2 id="product-overview">Product Overview</h2>

<p>Striking the balance between delivering a beautiful app and respecting the privacy of the user remains a task fraught with difficult tradeoffs.</p>

<p>One such tradeoff is the collection of application metrics from users as they use the application - in that process, people have little insight into what is being collected and how it may be used, within or outside of its intended purpose.</p>

<p>The decentralized open metrics idea is an experiment to explore fully transparent metrics collection where the data is available to the user and to anyone else as it’s being collected, with minimal leakage outside of its stated scope.</p>

<p>Metrics are generally not limited to data that is explicitly generated for the purpose of tracking, but also include other traces that the user might leave behind as they navigate the application, such as transactions and dapp assets hosted on web sites, and part of the product idea is to explore ways to expose and break down these trails for the user such that they become accessible and understandable.</p>

<p>To explore as part of this project is how to ensure that data retention laws such as GDPR are accounted for.</p>

<h3 id="user-stories">User Stories</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I want to understand what trails I leave behind when using the application, including blockchain transactions and dapp interactions, and how these may be combined</li>
  <li>I want to contribute to the development of Status anonymously by letting the application collect tracking data</li>
  <li>I want to limit specific types of data that Status collects when I use the application</li>
  <li>I want to export the data conveniently for my own analysis</li>
  <li>I want meaningful information that I can make sense of, opposed to datapoints</li>
  <li>As a status developer, I want to build the right features for our users, and want to understand adoption</li>
  <li>As a dapp developer, I want to understand how users interact with my dapp</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="security-and-privacy-implications">Security and Privacy Implications</h3>

<p>Guideline: if not a primary necessity for application to            perform its tasks, should it be there?</p>

<p>The security and privacy implications of enabling tracking in any application are significant - there are many things that can go wrong when creating a corpus of behavioral data, specially when valuable assets are involved.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Reliance on vendor
    <ul>
      <li>IP address disclosure</li>
      <li>Vendor incentives to collect more than stated</li>
      <li>Vendor may be hacked or bought out, transferring the data to another entity</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Radical openness
    <ul>
      <li>If we’re uncomfortable exposing our data publically we should not be collecting it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Risks
    <ul>
      <li>Unintended leakage of data</li>
      <li>Correlation between tracking data and other events
        <ul>
          <li>Liability for status in case of fallout from such correlations</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Doxing / deanonymization</li>
      <li>No way of turning off, once decentralized</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Filtering
    <ul>
      <li>Allowing user to selectively share data - for example, chat ok but transaction not</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Community
    <ul>
      <li>Community members might prefer that data is not fully public    but only available to trusted parties</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
