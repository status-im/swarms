<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Alpha builds of Status should default to Mainnet. We should be using Status in a real-world environment.</p>

<h2 id="product-overview">Product Overview</h2>

<p>Currently the Status alpha builds use testnet, but using Mainnet is a key milestone for the public launch of Status. There will be potentially major performance and security implications so the goal is to surface these issues early enough by testing the app in a real-world environment.</p>

<p>From a users perspective, Mainnet should be a default network as it is required by most popular DApps, and is needed for real transactions, so the full potential of Status can’t be seen until we switch. The other networks will continue to be available, e.g. for developers and tests.</p>

<h2 id="product-description">Product Description</h2>

<p>This is a default setting change, so there aren’t any user facing options. The other networks are still visible.</p>

<p>Some users, such as DApp creators may want to test their app on testnet (or some other use case), so they will be able to toggle networks as can be done currently.</p>

<h2 id="requirements--dependancies">Requirements &amp; Dependancies</h2>

<p>Security and performance should should be discussed and considered.</p>

<p>Also, several DApps should be tested.</p>

<h2 id="minimum-viable-product">Minimum Viable Product</h2>

<p><strong>This MVP does not mean that after it’s finished we release the app with Mainnet enabled by default but defines prerequisites that should be done before we consider doing so.</strong></p>
