<h2 id="summary-and-goals">Summary and Goal(s)</h2>

<p>Status Core Improvements swarm’s goal is the preparation of Status Mobile Client to be released publicly (AppStore/GP release tracks).</p>

<p>A few key areas that we need to focus on:</p>

<ul>
  <li>all the critical security and privacy issues are resolved (including audit);
    <ul>
      <li>a security and privacy document is delivered (it lists guarantees we make around security and privacy; as well as ways we are falling short)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>all the critical tech debt issues are resolved;</li>
  <li>key UX problems are solved in two areas:
    <ul>
      <li>adoption issues;</li>
      <li>retention issues.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The work includes releasing internal “dogfood” builds as well as betas in preparation to the public release.</p>
