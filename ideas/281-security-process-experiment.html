<p>The Security Experiment consists of a Security Process and potentially a few
one-time projects, like retroactively threat-modeling the app and setting up
the security-related automation features.</p>

<p>This experiment starts in a limited amount of teams (pilot) and to be expanded
if successful.</p>

<p>Pilot is limited to <code class="highlighter-rouge">#core-wallet</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">#core-dapps</code> projects.</p>
