<h2 id="product-overview">Product Overview</h2>

<p>ERC721 tokens, or non-fungible tokens (NFTs), represent unique assets on the blockchain. The ability to use rare digial assets as a store of value has spawned a large market of digital collectibles.</p>

<p>With 100+ digital collectibles on the market and a combined sales volume greater than $50MM, it’s important that we allow users to access their NFT collections inside Status right alongside their ETH and ERC20 tokens.</p>

<p>The two primary cases we need to support are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Having my existing collectibles in my Status wallet</li>
  <li>Buying or receiving new collectibles and seeing them in my Status wallet</li>
</ol>

<p>Additional use cases may focus on gifting collectibles from one user to another, or sending collectibles in a chat.</p>

<h3 id="product-description">Product Description</h3>

<h5 id="for-already-owned-crypto-assets">For already owned crypto assets</h5>

<p>Users should be able to view their collection of NFTs in a dedicated section of their Status wallet. 
Tokens associated with a user’s Mainnet address should appear there automatically.</p>

<p>Any ERC721 token should be supported, and individual assets within a collection should display available metadata such as name or number, properties, creation date, etc. To whatever extent possible, we can standardize the metadata displayed for each type of collectible and provide a link to the DApp for more.</p>

<h5 id="for-newly-purchased-crypto-assets">For newly purchased crypto assets</h5>

<p>When a user buys a new collectible through some other browser, it should automatically appear in their Status wallet. Same goes for collectibles that can be gifted, as is the case with Cryptokitties; Status should recognize when a user receives a new collectible as a gift.</p>

<p>A user should also be able to purchase collectibles from the Status browser, and the collectible should appear in their wallet.</p>

<p>Initially we can use marketplaces to support this by consuming metadata from <a href="https://opensea.io/">Opensea.io</a> or <a href="https://rarebits.io/">Rarebits.io</a>, but users should also be able to purchase new collectibles inside each DApp.</p>

<h3 id="requirements--dependencies">Requirements &amp; Dependencies</h3>
