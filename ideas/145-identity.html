<h2 id="product-overview">Product Overview</h2>

<p>Self sovereign identity can disrupt single sign on services by using blockchain ledger, smart contracts and encryption techniques.</p>

<h4 id="traditional-sign-in">Traditional sign-in:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Verification of personal information is required for each single sign on service.</li>
  <li>Services usually require trusting your personal information to multiple companies, which may collect it.</li>
  <li>Some services require payment credentials to be stored in their database, which might be abused.</li>
  <li>Recovering lost/compromised Identity requires an authorithy, which might be censored/abused.</li>
  <li>Access to your Identity is available as long as service decides.</li>
</ol>

<p>In traditional services you can get conforted by having an authority taking care of your data, which not only control your access to it, but also can read it (and sell it).</p>

<h4 id="self-sovereign-identity-sign-in">Self-sovereign identity sign-in:</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Verified claims over Identity could be required by services.</li>
  <li>Personal data is held by Identity owner</li>
  <li>Payment system is done by payment authorizations made by Identity owner.</li>
  <li>Recovering lost/compromised Identity is done by recovery smart contracts, such as 152-friends-recover .</li>
  <li>Access to Identity is available as long as owner decides.</li>
</ol>

<p>In self-sovering identity its owner have full resposability over its safety, but also have full control of their Identity.</p>

<h4 id="fundamental-terms">Fundamental terms:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>ID Manager (owner) can define MultiSig public keys required for its management/actions;</li>
  <li>ID Manager can define a Recovery contract;</li>
  <li>ID Manager can define public keys for other; users knowing how to encrypt data for identity owner;</li>
  <li>ID Manager can accept claims;</li>
  <li>ID Manager can make claims.</li>
  <li>ID Actor can call other contracts.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="status-use-case">Status Use Case:</h4>

<p>From user perspective, instead of talking to obscure address/contracts, users  would able to confirm that a person is whom they expect to be interacting.
Mainly because they usually know by community network who is the Identity holder and can safely assume is the right person.</p>

<p>This is important for chat system, where Identities provide the right key for others messaging, and Identity owners can always update this keys as they want.</p>

<p>Recovery contract, if safely defined, will garantee that Identity owner is able to get back their Identity from loss or theft, therefore no need to create a new one and ask friends to update their contact list with your new Identity.</p>

<h2 id="success-metrics">Success Metrics</h2>

<p>Status Users opt-in using an Identity to enhance interaction with decetralize systems (such as Status itself). 
Developers start using Status Identity implementation as base.
New users adopt Status because Identity support, which will be required for many dapps in future.</p>

<h2 id="exit-criteria">Exit criteria</h2>

<p>Fully integrated on Status App
    - Users can create new Indeitity
    - Users can manage their Identities
    - Users can use (action) Identities to call contracts</p>
