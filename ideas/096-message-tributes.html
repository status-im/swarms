<h2 id="product-overview">Product Overview</h2>
<p>This enables stakeholders to set a minimum amount of SNT that a Status stakeholder must deposit in order for someone outside of their network to contact him directly. If the recipient replies the deposit is forfeited to the recipient.</p>

<p><strong>SNT Utility</strong></p>

<p>SNT is deposited, and transferred from stakeholders to recipients upon receiving a reply from the recipient.</p>

<p>Example use-cases</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stakeholder A, a professional, would like to reach out to a high profile figure in the same industry, but would otherwise have no means of receiving a response.</li>
  <li>Stakeholder B, an artist and celebrity wishes to spend some time chatting with fans, and also desires a means of monetizing their fan base.</li>
  <li>Stakeholder C, a freelancer, provides photography tutorials, and has a means of generating revenue.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="product-description">Product Description</h3>
<p>Any Status user can enable Tribute to Talk and set a minimum required deposit for other users to stake in order to send them a message. Users requiring a tribute can whitelist their full contact list, or specific contacts.</p>

<p>If User A requires a minimum 200 SNT deposit, User B will not be able to open a new chat with User A until they deposit at least 200 SNT. Once deposited, User B can send their message.</p>

<p>If User A responds to User B’s message, the deposit is transferred to User A, and a conversation is opened.</p>

<p>If User A does not respond or User B changes their mind, User B can cancel or withdraw the request. The request will also time out automatically if User A does not respond in some number of days. In any case where User A does not respond, the deposit is returned to User B.</p>

<p>If User A rejects User B’s request, User B’s deposit is returned. User B will have to wait some amount of time before they are able to send a new request to User A.</p>

<p>In the future, User A might have the option to respond to User B but waive the deposit. User B might have the option to make a tribute to User A without requiring a response.</p>
