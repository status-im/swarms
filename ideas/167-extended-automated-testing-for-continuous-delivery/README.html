Title: Functional automated testing as a part of Continuous Delivery process
Status: In Progress
Created: 2018-04-12
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>For automated testing to be a part of CD process we need to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>increase coverage</li>
  <li>increase reliability</li>
  <li>provide visible results on daily basis</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="product-overview">Product Overview</h2>
<p>Extended set of automated tests which will run against each nightly build in order to provide results via TestRun in TestRail + short summary via Slack notification
As result during nightly build testing a tester should execute only those tests which are not covered by automation in the same TestRun
In case of failure in automated test a tester should add an appropriate status to the test (see <code class="highlighter-rouge">An option to review results should be added for each test via adding 4 statuses to TestRail</code> in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Product Description</code> section)
Actual sanity test case which is running against each PR will keep running without changes</p>

<h3 id="product-description">Product Description</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Each automated test suite should be based on existing set of cases from TestRail for tracking percents of functional test coverage</li>
  <li>Each automated test should be the reflection of a test case from TestRail</li>
  <li>Results of each automated test from a build should be provided via TestRun in TestRail and linked to the appropriate case</li>
  <li>An option to review results should be added for each test via adding 4 statuses to TestRail:
    <ul>
      <li>feature changed (for changed product behavior)</li>
      <li>known bug (link to the issue)</li>
      <li>false failure (bug in test)</li>
      <li>infrastructure issue</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="minimum-viable-product">Minimum Viable Product</h3>
<p>Goal Date: 2018-05-01</p>

<ul>
  <li>New test suite is add to TestRail (<code class="highlighter-rouge">Functional tests for Nightly Build</code>)</li>
  <li>80% of test cases for nightly build test suite from TestRail are covered by automated tests</li>
  <li>Extended set of automated tests is running against each nightly build</li>
  <li>Detailed test results are provided in TestRail via TestRuns + short summary via Slack notification</li>
</ul>

<p>Testing Days required: 10</p>

<h2 id="success-metrics">Success Metrics</h2>
<ul>
  <li>80% of functional test cases in <code class="highlighter-rouge">Functional tests for Nightly Build</code> are covered</li>
  <li>not more than 10% of tests are failing due to an issue with a test</li>
  <li>results are visible and understandable for all status-react team members</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exit-criteria">Exit criteria</h2>
<p>Extended set of automated tests covers 80% of functional nightly test cases from TestRail
The set is running against each nightly build
Results are visible in TestRail as TestRuns, also summary is visible in Slack notifications</p>
